# Package example 

This is a Github repo for an example package from the book Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow from Manning.

The folder src/airflowbook/operators contains operators
that are needed for Chapter09 and is not required for 
Chapter08. Actually, the file airflowbook/operators.py
could be deleted, but I decided to keep it
since it makes the Chapter08 complete.
